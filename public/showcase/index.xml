      <description>The Idea Imagine you were a bird soaring through the world, effortlessly flapping your wings or diving with remarkable speed. We wanted to create a small game from this idea. But before we could work on the realisation of the game, we had to think about a few things.
We needed a goal for the small game itself. We wanted to show the manoeuvrability of a birds by constructing a parkour.</description>

      <description>What is Flappy Bird Reimagined? With the original hit Flappy Bird as inspiration, we have used the Crossforge engine to bring Flappy Bird into 3 dimensions, our protagonist in this case is a hummingbird who maneuvers his way through the endless rows of buildings.
How it was made In the following sections, we will briefly introduce the parts that make up Flappy Bird Reimagined
Our &amp;ldquo;protagonist&amp;rdquo; / actor For our main character, we used a hummingbird model from Sketchfab with pre-made animations that we customized and tailored to our needs.</description>

      <description>Why a mapbuilder? During the creation of the Checkpoin Race , we wanted to try and create a map builder that would allow you to create and play new maps. We were only able to develop a simple prototype, but we still wanted to show how we did it.
Our approach When starting out, we decided to use a grid-based builder to keep the overall structure simple.
Our aim is to highlight the specific functions we have implemented, starting with the creation of the grid</description>
